Building   components  using  loop
conditional  rendering  of   components 

//understanding   virtual  dom  

react   creates   2  doms  main  and  a  replica  of  then   main  dom  which  we  call  a  virtual  dom
in  react  the  main  dom  is  not  directly  hampared  
wen  u  do  anychange  a  new   virtual dom  is  created 
compares   previous  virtual   and  the   initial   vr  dom   and  callculates   wats  new  here  and  updates  only  what  is  in  new   virtual  dom 
Reacts   works   on  the   arctual    element  that  was  changed  ....

-------Building   components  using  loops 
data   will  come   in  form  of   an  array  array  of   objects 
function Countries (){

    let [ countries  , setCountris]  =  useState([
        {name:"india" , capital:"New delhi"},
        {country:"kenya"  , capital:"Nairobi"},
        {france:"Paris" , capital:"Paris"}
    ])

    using   map  to  loop  through   an  array  
    map   loops  thro  an  array   and  has  the   ability  of   returning  some  data 




let   arr  =  [  1  ,  2,  3,  4,  5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
//map  maps   thro  an  elememt  and    at  every  iittaretion  ana  element  is   available 


//for  each loops   thro  all  the   elements  n one by  one  and  it  has  a  callback   ellem  for  each   ele e0

arr.forEach( (ele)=>{
  console.log(ele)
})

//map  similar   to  foreach   but  has   ability  to  return
//all  elements   returned  by  map  are  available  in  an  arrr

let  newArr   =  arr.map((ele)=>{
    return  ele*2;
})

console.log(newArr)
