.gitignore  =   files  and   folders  u  dont  want  to  upload  to   git    when you  are uploading  projects  to  git
index.html  =  simple   div   with  an  id  of  root   the  main file  in  ur  project

Component  a  function  returning  an  html 

Index &  App  Component   ,   main  component

*All  components   shld  be   directly  or  indirectlyn   loaded  to  app  component
