  all  attributes   are  properties 

  <Product/>   go  to  the  component  and  pass  properties  

    <Product  name:"peter"/>    loading  a  componet   and  passing props

    import React from "react"

function  Product(props){
    return(
        <div>    Tesla   Model1 </div>
    )
}

export  default  = Product

let  n  =  peter
<p> {n}  </p>
